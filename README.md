# RW-HLL-AUTOSERVER

Hell Let Loose automatic game joiner. 

Got annoyed by the queue system so decided to make a script that automaticly joins while i'm eating dinner or doing other stuff. 
Would implementing a phone, sms or email system when game is joined be fun? hell yes! but i probably won't bother building it.
