# RW-HLL-AUTOSERVER

Hell Let Loose automatic game joiner. 

Got annoyed by the queue system so decided to make a script that automaticly joins while i'm eating dinner or doing other stuff. 

Install this module for it to work
```pip install pyautogui```

You will get prompted when launching the script, fill in the server of your choice and it will automaticly fill into the ingame searchfilter.
