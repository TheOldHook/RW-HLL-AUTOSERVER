# RW-HLL-AUTOSERVER

Sick and tired of spamming join server to enter the queue? 👋🏾
I present you the Hell Let Loose automatic game joiner. 

Got annoyed by the queue system so decided to make a script that automaticly joins while i'm eating dinner or doing other stuff. 

Install this module for it to work:
```pip install pyautogui```

You will get prompted when launching the script, fill in the server name of your choice and it will automaticly fill into the ingame searchfilter.
